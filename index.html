        <h1> Creation Of The Goalie Mask </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> As you know Jacques Plante is the creator of the goalie mask. This marvelous invention has saved many people from getting injured. On November 1, 1959 Jacques Plante thought that this was just going to be a normal hockey game ,but what he didn’t know is that this game would be marked as one of the most historical moments in Hockey. After A slap shot fired by Andy Bagathe hit Jacques Plante in the nose, Plante had to be carried off the ice to get stitches. After Jaucques got his stitches he argued with his coach and refused to go back on the ice unless he could wear his goalie mask. Head coach Toe Blake was livid, but since he had no backup goalies he had no choice but to let Jacques wear the mask. After that game the Montreal Canadiens went on to have a winning streak of over 15 games! During this time Toe Blake Became less obstinate about the mask. Once Jacques’ injury was healed he discarded the mask and lost the next game. Then the game after that Jacques won with the goalie mask, and that was the moment that people knew the goalie mask was here to stay.

        <h1 style="f">Early Life</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
       <p> Early Life, Jacques Plante was born in Shawinigan Falls on January 17 1929 and died on February 27 1986. Plante was born with the disease Asthma which caused Jacques to skate very short periods of time, causing him to only be able to be a goalie. In 1932 Jacques fell off a ladder and broke his hand which affected his playstyle. The injury never healed so Jacques had to undergo corrective surgery as an adult. Jacques was born into a poor family and had 11 siblings, his father worked at a local factory. In 1931 when Jacques was 12 years old he went to go watch his school team practice, the team's goalie was sent off the ice after a heated argument with the team coach. Jacques asked the coach if he could fill in for the goalie. The coach said yes because there were no other goaltenders available. After a while it got pretty obvious that Jacques could stand his ground despite being much younger than the other boys. This marked the beginning of Jacques' professional career in hockey. <br> <br>

    <h1 style="f"> Achievements and Legacy </h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p>Achievements and legacy, Jacques plante achieved many things in his life including making it into the Hockey hall of fame, winning over 5 Vezina trophies! (a Vezina trophy is a trophy given to the best goalie in the NHL) and winning 6 Stanley Cups for the Montreal Canadiens! The thing everyone knows Jacques for is being the person that invented the goalie mask. Clint Benedict of the Montreal Maroons is the person that wore the goalie mask first to protect his broken nose but disposed of it after the injury was healed. The reason why Clint isn’t credited with being the person who invented the goalie mask is because Jacques made the goalie mask a mandatory piece of equipment to wear in the NHL. Jacques was also the first goalie to go out of the goalie crease to gain possession of the puck. Jacques was also one of the first to raise his hand on an icing call to let his defenseman know what was happening.<br> <br>

    <div class="line"></div>
        <p> Coaching and analysis, You may not know this but on top of being a top notch hockey player Jacques Plante was also a Coach! He has a well earned reputation for his ability to analyze a game because goaltenders usually have the best view of the rink. Jaucques has coached several NHL teams including the Philadelphia Flyers, Montreal Canadiens and the Saint Louis blues. Another interesting fact about Jacques is that he published a book called On Goaltending. The book shows the reader how to improve his/her goaltending. The book was a popular pick for coaches and players and was reprinted 25 years after it was published in english and french.<br> <br>
